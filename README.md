This is my goal oriented learning repo, where I learn stuff here's the current steps/goal:
  1- practice coding in C/C++/C#, Python as a primary phase => goal mastery of design patterns and programming patterns
    -[optional] add JS/Node/React/HTML/CSS as supplement.
  2- SQL/No SQL, GraphQL and in-memory databases => practice algorithms and data processing.
